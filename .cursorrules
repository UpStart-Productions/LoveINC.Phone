# Ionic Framework Rules

## Default Ionic Controls
- DO NOT embellish or add custom styling to default Ionic controls unless explicitly instructed by the user
- Ionic is its own UI framework with well-designed default components
- Use Ionic components out of the box with their default styling
- Only add custom styling when the user specifically requests it
- When working with forms, use standard Ionic form components (ion-item, ion-input, ion-select, etc.) with their default appearance
- Avoid adding custom CSS classes, borders, backgrounds, or padding to Ionic components unless requested

## Examples of what NOT to do:
- Adding custom card styling to form fields
- Adding custom borders or backgrounds to ion-item elements
- Overriding default Ionic component styles without being asked
- Creating custom wrappers around Ionic components when not needed

## Examples of what TO do:
- Use ion-list and ion-item as-is for form layouts
- Use default Ionic button styles
- Use standard Ionic input field styling
- Only modify styling when the user explicitly asks for it
